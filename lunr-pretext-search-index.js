If a physical quantity has both magnitude and direction, it is called vectorial . If it has only magnitude, it is called scalar .   Use your physical intuition to decide which of the following quantites are vectorial and which are scalar.  temperature  pressure  velocity  displacement  length  entropy  density  acceleration  mass     Graphically, a vector is represented as a line segment with an arrowhead placed on one end. The magnitude corresponds to its length and the direction corresponds to the direction that it points. Algebraically, a vector is represented by an -tuple of numbers, called its components. For example, is a vector in -dimensional space. (N.B. Angled brackets denote a vector, whereas round brackets denote a point.)  Graphically, the head of a vector is the end with the arrowhead, and the tail is the other end. When drawing a vector in Euclidean space, the point at which we place the tail is called the initial point , and the point at which we place the head is called the terminal point . If is the initial point and is the terminal point, we often write .   Suppose that the vector is represented as an arrow with terminal point . What is the initial point of the arrow?         The position vector of a point is the vector whose initial point is the origin and whose terminal point is .    You can think of the components of a vector as giving you the amount of the vector in the direction of each of the (two or) three axes. For example, the vector is sketched below.           Which of the follow best describes the distance from to , denoted ?                            Which expression best identifies the direction of the vector, denoted in the diagram, as an angle relative to the positive -axis?                                      Use trigonometry and\/or part (a) to find expressions for the length of and the length of in terms of the direction and the length .     The magnitude of a vector is the distance between its initial and terminal points. You can place the vector anywhere in Euclidean space, and use the resulting magnitude will be the same. For any vector , placing the tail at the origin, , means that the coordinates of the terminal point will be the same as the components of the vector. So, . This gives the formula   Two vectors are equal if they have the same magnitude and direction. Algebraically, this means the two vectors have the same components. Notice that neither the initial nor terminal point is mentioned in the definition of equality. So, graphically, this means the two vectors are equal if they can be superimposed by a translation.  There are two operations that can be performed on vectors: addition and scalar multiplication. They are defined algebraically as:    Properties of vector operations  Let , , and be vectors in and let and be scalars. Then             The vector has the property that .

A unit vector is a vector with unit length, i.e. length exactly 1.      For each vector, find its associated unit vector.                                 The unit vector is the vector whose first component 1 and all others are 0, is the one whose second component is 1 with all others 0, and is the one whose third component is 1 with all others 0.

Determine the velocity vector in miles per hour and express in component form and in terms of the standard unit vectors. Assume the ball is thrown in the plane.     Which of the following best expresses the horizontal component of the vector?                                      Which option best describes the vertical component of the vector?                                      Use your answers to (a) and (b) to write the velocity vector in component form.      Use your answers to (a) and (b) to write the velocity vector using the standard unit vectors. Remember that the ball is thrown in the plane.      Why would we consider the ball to be thrown in the plane rather than the plane or the plane?       In order to fly from Oklahoma City to Dayton, OH, a plane must fly east of north. A plane leaves Oklahoma City at a ground speed of 525 miles per hour. A 30 mph wind blows from the north during the flight.     What is the ground speed of the plane when the wind begins to blow?      What is the new bearing of the plane?       An object is said to be in static equilibrium if the resultant force of the forces that act on it is zero. Let , , and be three forces acting on an object.

We can parameterize a circle of radius centered at the origin by for in the interval . The circumference of this circle is the length of curve defined by , or as expected.    The length of curve defined by on the interval is .      We can adapt the arc length formula to curves in 2-space that define as a function of as the following activity shows.    Let define a smooth curve in 2-space. Parameterize this curve and use Equation to show that the length of the curve defined by on an interval is     We can parameterize on by for in . Then the length of the curve defined by on is .     Consider a circle of radius in 2-space centered at the origin. We know that we can parameterize this circle as where runs from 0 to . We see that , and hence . It then follows that   Since , we may solve for in terms of to obtain . We then find the arc length parametrization by composing   More generally, for a circle of radius centered at the origin, a similar computation shows that is an arc length parametrization.     In this activity we parameterize a line in 2-space in terms of arc length. Consider the line with parametric equations    To write in terms of , evaluate the integral to determine the length of the line from time 0 to time .

If is a smooth space curve and is an arc length parameter for , then the curvature curvature , , of is         We should expect that the curvature of a line is 0 everywhere. To show that our definition of curvature measures this correctly in 2-space, recall that gives us the arc length parameterization of a line. Use this information to explain why the curvature of a line is 0 everywhere.    Recall that an arc length parameterization of a circle in 2-space of radius centered at the origin is, from ,   Show that the curvature of this circle is the constant . What can you say about the relationship between the size of the radius of a circle and the value of its curvature? Why does this make sense?      We have .  So the curvature of a circle of radius is .  So, as expected, larger circles have smaller curvature.    The definition of curvature relies on our ability to parameterize curves in terms of arc length. Since we have seen that finding an arc length parametrization can be difficult, we would like to be able to express the curvature in terms of a more general parametrization .  To begin, we need to describe the vector , which is a vector tangent to the curve having unit length. Of course, the velocity vector is tangent to the curve; we simply need to normalize its length to be one. This means that we may take   Then the curvature of the curve defined by is   This last formula allows us to use any parameterization of a curve to calculate its curvature. There is another useful formula, given below, whose derivation is left for the exercises.   Formulas for curvature  If is a vector-valued function defining a smooth space curve , and if is not zero and if exists, then the curvature of satisfies         .

Assuming , at what points is the curvature the greatest and at what points is the curvature the smallest? Does this agree with your intuition?    The standard helix has parameterization . Find the curvature of the helix. Does the result agree with your intuition?         We have and . So the curvature of the ellipse is given by .
